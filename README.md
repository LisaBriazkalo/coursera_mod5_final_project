# 🗺️ Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto  
**Final Project – Module 5 (IBM Data Science Professional Certificate)**

This repository contains the final project notebook for Module 5 of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. The project demonstrates how to analyze, segment, and cluster neighborhoods in Toronto based on postal code and geospatial data.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Scrape neighborhood data from a Wikipedia page using `BeautifulSoup`
- Clean and structure the data using `pandas`
- Retrieve geospatial coordinates using the `geocoder` and `geopy` libraries
- Use the FourSquare API to explore each neighborhood and extract venue data
- Apply the **k-means clustering algorithm** to segment neighborhoods
- Visualize the clusters on an interactive map using `folium`

## 📁 File Description
- `mod5_final_project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all code, visualizations, and commentary.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries
- Python 3
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `geopy`
- `folium`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- FourSquare API

## 📍 Output
An interactive map showing clustered neighborhoods in Toronto based on their surrounding venues.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Web scraping and data wrangling
- Working with APIs (e.g., FourSquare)
- Geospatial data visualization
- Unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering)
